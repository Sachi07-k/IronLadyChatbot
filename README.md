# Iron Lady Chatbot

## Description
This is a simple chatbot built as part of the Iron Lady assignment.  
It answers common FAQs related to Iron Lady's leadership programs and provides an interactive chat interface.  

Additionally, an AI API integration (OpenAI/HuggingFace) was attempted to make responses more interactive.  
If the API is unavailable, the chatbot falls back to a keyword-based system, ensuring it always works.
